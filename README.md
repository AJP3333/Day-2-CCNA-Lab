## Connecting Devices

Connecting all the devices using different cables and the different properieties for each cable and device connection

- Start by connecting all the end devices to their appropriate switches using a straight through cable
- Then connect all the switches together on the same network and SW1 and 2 to Router 2 and SW5 and SW6 to Router 4
- Now for connecting routers you will need crossover cables and because R1 and R2 are 50 meters in distance and below 100 meters you can use a copper crossover cable, for R1 to R3 since its over 100 meters it uses km and its 3 km so you will use a fiber optic connection the single mode fiber, in Packet Tracer its only a fiber mode no selection for single or multimode so i will just label each cable separately single or multi.
- R3 to R4 will use a multimode cable being that they are 250 meters apart
